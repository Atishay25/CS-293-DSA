Assumptions :
1. I have made implemented both the parts of AVL and BST that were essentially required(find, insert)
2. I have assumed that you will first check my code on these essential requirements.
3. So, I also implemented Deletion in BST and AVL tree, I'm pretty sure of deletion working in BST tree,
   but for AVL a little error occurs in Deletion when the number of Node become greater than around 25000.
4. I assume that as this part was not essentially required and was Bonus, therefore you will not cut marks 
   of the essential part if my deletion in AVL does not work perfectly.
   However, it works correctly upto some extent. I'm sure there must be some little error, which I could have
   fixed if I would have got more time. But as this part was bonus, I guess it won't be a big issue because
   according to me, my basic parts of code that were required essentially are working correctly.
5. I also used updateParentChild function for incrementing pointer update cost in the insertion part of both BST and AVl.
